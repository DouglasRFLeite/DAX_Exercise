# DAX_Exercise
### DAX Exercise building a Sales, Cost, Profit and KPI Dashboard during Data Science Academy's Power BI course.

These are the reference, dataset and Dashboards I`ve built during the fourth chapter of [Data Science Academy's Power BI Course](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/course?courseid=microsoft-power-bi-para-data-science) as a case study. For more information on it check my Medium post [Introduction to DAX and M for Power BI with a Sample Dashboard](https://medium.com/@douglas.rochedo/introduction-to-dax-and-m-for-power-bi-with-a-sample-dashboard-8a3f4028b8a8).

PS: Data Science Acadamy is a Brazilian course given in Portuguese, thus, all of the content provided by the course is in Portuguese. All content in English is made by me and I shall not translate everything to English. So, if you want to understand better what I have done here, it is best you check the Medium post than try to understand from the content available here.
